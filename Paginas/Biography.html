            <p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to
                international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified Diamond by the RIAA
                in 2005 and multi-Platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album Meteora continued
                the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring
                and charity work.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and
                Meteora,the band explored other genres on their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).The album
                topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year. The band continued
                to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering
                their music with more electronic sounds and beats. Their fifth album, Living Things (2012), combines
                musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014),
                returned to a heavier rock sound. Their seventh album One More Light, a more electronic and pop-oriented
                record, was released on May 19, 2017.

                In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the
                new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. In
                2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In
                2014, the band was declared as the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now by Kerrang!. Linkin Park has
                sold over 75 million albums and singles worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.

                Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The
                three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating
                from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn,
                Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in
                resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in
                1996, resulting in a four-track demo tape, entitled Xero. Tensions and frustration within the band grew
                however after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted
                Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also
                left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.
            </p>

                After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona
                vocalist Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in
                March 1999.Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band by the name of Grey Daze, became a standout among
                applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing its name from
                Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the
                band, inciting them to work on new material. In 1999 the band released a self-titled extended play,
                which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online 'street team'.
                The band's renaissance culminated with another change in name, this time to Linkin Park, a play on and
                homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park (now called Christine Emerson Reed Park). The band initially
                wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park", however they changed it to "Linkin" to acquire the internet
                domain "linkinpark.com". The band still struggled to sign a record deal. Linkin Park turned to Jeff Blue
                for additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to
                catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Jeff Blue, now the vice president of Warner Bros.
                Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company in 1999. The band released its breakthrough album,
                Hybrid Theory, the following year.

                Linkin Park has sold more than 70 million records. The group's first studio album Hybrid Theory is one
                of the best-selling albums in the US (10 million copies shipped) and worldwide (27 million copies sold).
                Billboard estimates that Linkin Park earned US$5 million between May 2011 and May 2012, making them the
                40th-highest-paid musical artist. 11 of the band's singles have reached the number one position on
                Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, the second-most for any artist.
